  Use Case:
    Simple tool for handling Sprint Retrospectives. No account is necessary for this program and no premium is offered.
    The scrum master can create a Retro Board room and select from three template layouts or create their own.
    Once the layout has been selected, the scrum master may begin inviting each team member into the retro board room.
    A common layout is Good, Bad, and Action Items where each member can place a note under the columns of their choosing.
    User's may like these notes to signify that they agree with a note instead of creating multiple similar notes.
    This tool has an integrated timer to allow each user to input their thoughts on each column before time runs out.
