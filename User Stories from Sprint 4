Sprint #4 goal, results, and summation:
Goal : Enhance user trust with authentication, foster game submission activity, and revitalize entry points for ETSU students.
User stories, acceptance criteria, business value and results:
-	User story: As an ETSU student I want to be authenticated in some way to ensure that only ETSU students can play the games.
-	Acceptance Criteria: The website prompts the user to authenticate that they are indeed an ETSU student. This could be done through IP address authentication, login credentials, email confirmation with an Etsu domain, or geolocation. If authentication is successful, the user should be able to automatically start playing games. If authentication fails, the user should see an error message.
-	Business Value: This business value here is that there is an incentive to be an ETSU student. You must have the correct authentication/authorization to play. Especially because this will be a student-led project it makes sense for the business to only allow ETSU students to submit/play games.
-	Result: The team successfully implemented a rudimentary authentication system that will check and see if the user has an ETSU email address. If so, the user can login and play no problem. If it fails, the user will see a message saying “Only ETSU students can play our games. Sorry :(“.

-	User story: As an ETSU student developer, I want to be able to understand the criteria and specifications to submit my own game to the website.
-	Acceptance Criteria: On the website there should be some kind of document that specifies the criteria for game submissions. These criteria should include things like what language I should use, how it should fit into the screen, how it should play on different devices, whether there should be a start/end button, whether it needs to be inside of a function, how big the file can be, etc. This may involve looking at the games currently on the website and creating criteria from these games.
-	Business Value: The business value is that student developers can correctly code games to be submitted to our gaming website. Since consumers will directly benefit from well-coded standardized games, the business value is clear.
-	Result: The team successfully fulfilled the requirements and created game submission criteria. Below is a screenshot of the results. The instructions are clear and concise.
 

-	User story: As an ETSU student developer, I want to be able to submit my own games, so that other students can play and enjoy my creation.
-	Acceptance Criteria: There should be some kind of submission form that only authenticated ETSU students can access. The form should prompt for things like game title, description, and game file. The form should show or link to the game submission criteria "document". Students should only be able to submit the game if it meets the specified criteria - maybe by asking a series of questions. After successful submission, a confirmation message should be shown.
-	Business Value: This business value here is that consumers will get access to many more games if student developers have a clear and easy way of submitting their own creations. It will also foster a creative environment and boost student (customer) engagement.
-	Result: Our team successfully implemented a google form that asks for the GitHub URL for their contribution for review, title, description, ETSU email and how-to-play. The form is embedded on the BucStop website and shows a confirmation after submission. The google form is also linked to a spreadsheet so admins may review the request at anytime.

-	User story: As an admin or moderator, I want to review submitted games and their test results, so that I can ensure the quality and appropriateness of games added to the website.
-	Acceptance Criteria: The admin dashboard should now display a list of submitted games. Admins can see test case results for each game. Admins can approve or reject game submissions based on their quality, appropriateness, and test outcomes. Feedback is sent to the student developer upon approval or rejection.
-	Business Value: The business value here is to be able to automatically test game files before being able to approve them. This way there is automated (saving time) testing in place to ensure that the student code is a good fit for our website.
-	Result: This sprint user story was determined to be too ambitious during sprint grooming, so we readjusted to use GitHub and a google form and allow admins to manually approve GitHub pull requests instead. The admins will be able to approve a contribution allowing them to look over and approve the code before it can move into the main branch or pushed into production. The result was a success in the end because we accomplished a submission process for student developers (after readjusting the sprint user story in sprint planning).

-	User story: As a student user of the website, I want the home page to be well-organized and up-to-date with recent games and relevant information, so that I can easily find new content and navigate the site efficiently.
-	Acceptance Criteria: The home page should display a list of recently added games. There should be sections or widgets that highlight games that are popular among ETSU students. Navigation to the different sections of the website (e.g., game categories, leaderboard, user profile) must be intuitive and easily accessible. The home page should load quickly, maintaining a responsive design on various devices. Any promotional content or announcements relevant to ETSU students should be prominently displayed. The design and content should adhere to ETSU's branding guidelines to maintain consistency and credibility.
-	Business Value: The value here is to prominently display and welcome ETSU students, engaging them from the first moment. Showing popular games will excite the students to keep coming back to play more.
-	Result: Our team successfully implemented a carousel on the front page to display the most popular games on the website based on a counter. The counter increases every time a user plays a game and thus allows us to sort the carousel by the most popular games.

-	User story: As a student user of the website, I want the games list page to be resized accordingly to my mobile device.
-	Acceptance Criteria: The games list page should be mobile friendly. Right now, the images are not resizing on IOS phones.
-	Business Value: The business value is to be user-friendly to all users regardless of device size. Most students use their phones so it’s important to be friendly with that demographic.
-	Result: The team successfully implemented mobile resizing on the games list page and it’s working and tested with mobile devices.

-	User story: As a student developer, I want the deployment process to be completely automated from GitHub push into production.
-	Acceptance Criteria: After a push into main branch, the deployment process should be fully automated without any manual intervention.
-	Business Value: The value here is to reduce time when pushing things into production or even a development environment. The more time the development team can save deploying is more time that can be spent developing for customers.
-	Result: The team successfully implemented an auto-deploy feature that is completely automated through GitHub Actions. Once something is pushed into the main branch (being production ready) it will automatically push to the production server and update accordingly with no manual intervention required.
